# Parenting Simulator

**Objective:**  
To vividly demonstrate the unintended yet profound psychological harm caused by traditional Chinese parenting.

**Framework:**  
The core concept is deliberately straightforward—admittedly, it might look terrible now, and frankly, it probably still will in the future.

**Inspiration and Data:**  
This simulator is inspired by classic cases of typical Chinese-style authoritarian parents ("霸总家长"), combined with common pitfalls outlined in psychological parenting research.

**Implementation:**  
Using the above scenarios as foundational input, the project aims to employ AI to automatically generate parenting scenes.

**Disclaimer:**  
Whether or not this actually works out—well, that's yet to be seen.
